#                                                                         *
# This file is used to set the classes and options for                    *
# the MadAnalysis program.                                                *
#                                                                         *
#                                                                         *
# Some comments about the classes                                         *
# 1. Plots are for classes of particles.                                  *
# 2. Each particle is identified by its PDG code.                         *
# 3. Classes names are arbitrary (4 symbols max, no spaces allowed).      *
# 4. Particles in the same class will be ordered with the 'ordering       *
#    function' in the file in_func.f.                                     *
# 5. Classes can be added/edited/removed at will, and given a name        *
#    that will then appear in the plots.                                  *
# 6. A particle can be put in one class only. Putting a particle in       *
#    two or more classes can lead to double counting of events.           *
# 7. The class name mET is missing Energy and its name is reserved.       *
#    If used, it must be put last in the classes list below.              *
# 8. If events contain particles not belonging to an existing class,      *
#    a new class will automatically be generated.                         *
# 9. For LHCO events the PDG code 21 is assigned to a jet (not            *
#    b-tagged), 5 to a b-tagged jet and 12 to missing ET.                 *
#                                                                         *
#                                                                         *
# Some comments about the cuts                                            *
# 1. In the file kin_func.f the functions on which cuts can be applied    *
#    are given.                                                           *
# 2. The syntax is as follows.                                            *
#      etmin 1 3 30d0                                                     *
#     means that from the first class the Et of the first three particles *
#     has to be greater than 30 GeV.                                      *
#                                                                         *
#      etmissmin 20d0                                                     *
#     means that there must be at least 20 GeV of missing Et              *
#                                                                         *
#      dRmin 2 1 4 3 3d0                                                  *
#     means that the distance between the first particle in the second    *
#     class and the first three particles in the fourth class has to be   *
#     greater than 3.                                                     *
#                                                                         *
#      ptmax 1 3 10d0                                                     *
#      ptmax 1 2 15d0                                                     *
#     means that the maximum pt of the third particle in the first class  *
#     has to smaller than 10 GeV, and the first two particles of this     *
#     class has to be smaller than 15 GeV                                 *
# 3. The ordering of the particles within a class can be set with the     *
#    'ordering function' in the file kin_func.f.                          *
# 4. For all the 'min' cuts, an event will be thrown away if the particle *
#    does not exist. On the other hand, for all the 'max' cuts the cut    *
#    will be ignored if the particle does not exist                       *
#    (Only dRij is an exception, for which it is the other way around)    *
#                                                                         *
#                                                                         *
#                                                                         *
# Some comments about the plotting options                                *
# 1. In the file kin_func.f the functions can be found that can be        *
#    plotted. (only for off-line usage)                                   *
# 2. With the plotting options one can set the number of plots for each   *
#    of these functions.                                                  *
# 3. One has to specify for each variable which particles from which      *
#    class are used to set the plots. Syntax:                             *
#    	et  2 4                                                           *
#    means that the transverse energy of the first four particles in the  *
#    second class will be plotted.                                        *
#       mij 1 3                                                           *
#	mij 2 2                                                           *
#    means that for the invariant mass plots the first three particles    *
#    from the first class and the first two from the second class will be *
#    used to plot the invariant mass of two particles. (10 plots)         *
# 4. The ordering of the particles in a class can be set with the         *
#    'ordering_function'. pt, e and et are valid functions. (For off-line *
#    users X1, X2 and X3 can also be used, if defined in kin_func.f.)     *
# 5. Max number of plots is 200.                                          *
#                                                                         *
#                                                                         *
